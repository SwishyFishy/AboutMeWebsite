            <h3>Trent Magic the Gathering Community</h3>
            <span>3 years</span>
            <p>
                The Trent Magic the Gathering Community, or TMTGC, is Trent University's Magic: the Gathering club. When I joined in my first year it was nearly dead - its founding members had all left the year prior, leaving a single 4th year student in charge, who had no interest in advertising or rebuilding a playerbase. I took sole control when he graduated that year, and I'm very proud to say that the club completely recovered.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the course of the three years that I ran the club, we increased from 2 to 10 regular attendees, with an additional 15+ semi-regular attendees. I worked with the TCSA, the body at Trent which oversees student clubs, to secure advertising and funding for the club and the activities I ran. I also mentored two lower-year students to take over the executive role I filled upon my graduation, and thus far they've done an excellent job.
