            <h3>JCI McDonalds</h3>
            <span>4+ years</span>
            <span>Shift Manager for 1.5+ years</span>
            <p>
                I started at JCI McDonalds in June 2021. I soon moved up to the Crew Trainer position. There, I trained and verified a plethora of new hires on various stations. In January 2024, I was fully certified as a Shift Manager.

                While taking classes at university, I worked a part-time schedule, anywhere from 16-24 hours per week. Over the summer months, and as of my graduation, I've worked full-time 40 hour weeks. As a shift manager, it's my job to run the store for the duration of my shift, utilizing the scheduled crew to complete all of the tasks while still delivering an excellent customer experience.
